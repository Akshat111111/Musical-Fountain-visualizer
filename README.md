# Musical Fountain Visualizer

The Musical Fountain Visualizer is similar to basic pattern produced in a musical fountain.Its a application employing the Web Audio API to facilitate an interactive audio-based visualization. This application is constructed using HTML,CSS  and JavaScript, the fundamental web technologies.

The functionality enables users to upload an audio file, which is subsequently processed and visualized in real-time on the screen. The visualization leverages a canvas element, generating a dynamic and immersive audio-reactive visual representation.

The core processing logic utilizes the Web Audio API to create an audio context, analogous to a canvas context, in which the audio file is processed and analyzed. This analysis includes the extraction of critical data points from the audio file, such as frequency and amplitude values, which are then used as input for the visualization rendering process.

The rendering process on the canvas employs the requestAnimationFrame method, invoking a callback function prior to each repaint, at a rate of 60 frames per second. This approach guarantees a smooth and visually seamless experience that is synchronized with the audio playback.

Additionally, the application incorporates a digital television glitch effect as an overlay on the canvas to enhance the visual experience. This effect is achieved using a `div` element with the id `background`.

In essence, the Musical Fountain Visualizer serves as a practical demonstration of the potential of the Web Audio API in creating interactive and visually appealing audio visualizations.
